1. Evaluate the COLLECTIVE performance of document creation and quality management
2. Score each criterion from 0-100 points
3. Focus on final document excellence and quality assurance
4. If overall score < {self.quality_threshold*100:.0f}%, provide specific improvement suggestions
5. This is the final output - apply highest standards for evaluation

Team: Strategy Team
Company: {getattr(state, 'company_name', 'N/A')}

Quality Threshold: {self.quality_threshold*100:.0f}%

=== PREVIOUS ANALYSIS CONTEXT (for reference) ===

=== EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Evaluate the COLLECTIVE performance of both strategy research agents
2. Score each criterion from 0-100 points
3. Focus on strategic advantage development and competitive positioning
4. If overall score < {self.quality_threshold*100:.0f}%, provide specific improvement suggestions
5. Consider how well this strategic analysis supports writing guidance phase
